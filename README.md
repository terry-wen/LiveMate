### Market Info
    
#Competitors:
    - Facebook (Artist Pages)
    - Craiglist (Swiss army knife of finding services)

#What will LiveMate do that our Competitors cannot?
    - Hard to find performers by location on Facebook, no booking functionality.
    - Craiglist makes finding acts by location simple, however, there is no booking functionality.
    - Furthermore, from a 'Performer' perspective, Craigslist makes creating a unique page hard (bio, music, images), something Facebook is great at.
